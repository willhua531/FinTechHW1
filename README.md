### ***What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?***
  * Since most of these companies are private companies, revenue and profitability and margins are nowhere to find, so I think the number of users is a key performamce measurement. 
  * Even though they are an online banking provider, their customers also need the ability of being able to withdraw or deposit cash, so the quantity of in-network ATMs is also very important. 
  * They have 11m app downloads and 38000 fee-free MoneyPass or Visa Plus Alliance ATMs in the U.S.  
### ***How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?***
  * They are at the top of the game.
